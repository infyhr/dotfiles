dotfiles
========
My own dotfiles. I use [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org) (Manjaro, to be precise):
* Linux A780LM-M 3.10.56-1-MANJARO #1 SMP Mon Oct 6 03:08:30 UTC 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux

*Note: Windows (dos) directory has been discontinued since I do not use Windows anymore for development at all.
In the Unix folder you can find my bash config, i3, some dzen/conky stuff and that's about it. There is also an .Xresources file in there.*
