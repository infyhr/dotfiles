dotfiles
========
My own dotfiles. I use [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org)
* Linux storm 4.0.1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Apr 29 12:00:26 CEST 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux

*Note: Windows (dos) directory has been ~~discontinued~~ removed since I do not use Windows anymore for development at all.
In the Unix folder you can find my bash config, i3, some dzen/conky stuff and that's about it. There is also an .Xresources file in there.*
